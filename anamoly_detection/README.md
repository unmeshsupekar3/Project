### Brief Description
The ARIMA(2, 1, 0) model was applied to a time series dataset of 4032 observations. The model coefficients are statistically significant, suggesting a strong relationship with past values. Diagnostic tests indicate no significant autocorrelation but highlight issues with residual normality and heteroskedasticity. The model's MSE is 5.857, demonstrating good predictive performance despite some residual issues.
